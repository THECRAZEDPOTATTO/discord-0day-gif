# discord-0day-gif [patch for now] im testing for a new one please hold
They patched it as soon as I found it so please hold
So basically you send someone the gif and as 
Soon as they open you message you get there 
Token and roblox cookie I know it sound not 
Possible but trust my friend it more then is.
How it works
---------------------------------------------
using an error in discord that I found you can trigger a page rederect 
when hovering over a gif now from here you can just use an image logger ect 
but how ever it will not be as good. Once the user is rederect to our malicious
we can inject our scripts Javascript and php scripts or we can ditch the site and just embed an exe using image logger method 
The need for the .gif is so it acts like an image as soon as it is hovered over auto running malicious program with out the user having 
to click on the image aka .gif  
Most if not all of the image loggers you see on tiktok or on discord are fake 100% they are skids who watched one video on node js or python PLEASE WATCH OUT DON't BE DUMB
image logger with exes are 100% fake as of now I think.
